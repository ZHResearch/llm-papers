  - title: How Close is ChatGPT to Human Experts? Comparison Corpus, Evaluation, and Detection [Jan 2023]
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07597
    entries:
      - title: This work collected tens of thousands of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with questions ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and psychological areas, and builds three different detection systems, explore several key factors that influence their effectiveness, and evaluate them in different scenarios.

  - title: "WavCaps: A ChatGPT-Assisted Weakly-Labelled Audio Captioning Dataset for Audio-Language Multimodal Research [Mar 2023]"
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17395
    entries:
      - title: This work introduces WavCaps, the first large-scale weakly-labelled audio captioning dataset, and proposes a three-stage processing pipeline for filtering noisy data and generating high-quality captions, where ChatGPT, a large language model, is leveraged to filter and transform raw descriptions automatically.

  - title: "Exploring the Feasibility of ChatGPT for Event Extraction [Mar 2023]"
    url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03836
    entries:
      - title: The usability testing experiments indicate that ChatGPT is not robust enough, and continuous refinement of the prompt does not lead to stable performance improvements, which can result in a poor user experience.
